# Responsive-Website-Design

The purpose of this repository is to create a website that is responsive and to go over the things listed below

Grid design (They good for two dimensional design)
- to turn an html element into a grid container, you must set element's display property to one of the two values
- grid (for a block-level grid)
- inline-grid (for an inline grid)
- We can define the columns of our grid by using the CSS property grid-template-columns, grid-template-rows (grid-template for combining both)


- grid-template-rows defines the number and sizes of the rows of the grid
- grid-template is a shorthand for defining both grid-template-columns and grid-template-rows in one line
- row-gap puts blank space between the rows of the grid
- column-gap puts blank space between the columns of the grid
- gap is a shorthand for defining both row-gap and column-gap in one line
- grid-row-start and grid-row-end makes elements span certain rows of the grid
- grid-column-start and grid-column-end makes elements span certain columns of the grid
- grid-area is a shorthand for grid-row-start, grid-column-start, grid-row-end, and grid-column-end, all in one line
