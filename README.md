The purpose of this repository is to create a website that is responsive and to go over the things listed below

Grid design (They good for two dimensional design)
- to turn an html element into a grid container, you must set element's display property to one of the two values
- grid (for a block-level grid)
- inline-grid (for an inline grid)
- We can define the columns of our grid by using the CSS property grid-template-columns, grid-template-rows (grid-template for combining both)
